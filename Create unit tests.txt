There is a code with Student class and StudentConverter that is using this class:

	public class Student
	{
		public string Name { get; set; }

		public int Age { get; set; }

		public int Grade { get; set; }

		public bool Exceptional { get; set; }

		public bool HonorRoll { get; set; }

		public bool Passed { get; set; }
	}

	public class StudentConverter
	{
		public List<Student> ConvertStudents(List<Student> students)
		{
			return students.Select(student =>
			{
			var result = new Student
			{
				Name = student.Name,
				Age = student.Age,
				Grade = student.Grade
			};
				if (student.Grade > 90)
				{
					if (student.Age < 21)
					{
						result.Exceptional = true;
					}
					else
					{
						result.HonorRoll = true;
					}
				}
				else if (student.Grade > 70)
				{
					result.Passed = true;
				}
				else
				{
					result.Passed = false;
				}

				return result;
			}).ToList();
		}
	}
	
Create unit tests (using xUnit) that cover ConvertStudents function. Cover following test cases 

Positive Test Cases: 

	Case 1: High Achiever 
		Given an array with a student object of age 21 or above and grade above 90, the function should return an object with the additional field HonorRoll = true. 

	Case 2: Exceptional Young High Achiever 
		Given an array with a student object of age less than 21 and grade above 90, the function should return an object with the additional field Exceptional = true. 

	Case 3: Passed Student 
		Given an array with a student object of grade between 71 and 90 (inclusive), the function should return an object with the additional field Passed = true. 

	Case 4: Failed Student 
		Given an array with a student object of grade 70 or less, the function should return an object with the additional field Passed = false. 

Negative Test Cases: 

	Case 1: Empty Array 
		Given an empty array, the function should return an empty array. 

	Case 2: Not an Array  
		Given a null as an input the function should throw an error.

Here is how you can create unit tests for the mentioned scenarios using xUnit:

csharp
Copy code
using Xunit;
using System.Collections.Generic;

public class StudentConverterTests

    private readonly StudentConverter _converter;

    public StudentConverterTests()

        _converter = new StudentConverter();

    {
        List<Student> students = null;

        Assert.Throws<ArgumentNullException>(() => _converter.ConvertStudents(students));
    }
}
Please note, you will need to add the appropriate using directive at the top of your file for ArgumentNullException.

Each [Fact] attribute denotes a method that contains a unit test. In these tests, we first arrange the test scenario, then call the method under test and finally make assertions about the expected outcome.

You may also consider adding more specific assertions to test that the other properties are not being set inappropriately, and possibly adding tests for boundary conditions such as exactly 21 years old and exactly 70 or 90 grade.

generate a list of random 20 objects of Student, of age 21 or above and grade above 90



ChatGPT
Here is a simple way to generate a list of 20 Student objects with an age of 21 or above and a grade above 90. In this example, I'll use Random to generate age between 21 and 30 and grade between 91 and 100.

csharp
Copy code
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;

public class StudentGenerator
{
    private static readonly Random random = new Random();

    public List<Student> GenerateStudents(int numberOfStudents)
    {
        var students = new List<Student>();

        for (int i = 0; i < numberOfStudents; i++)
        {
            students.Add(new Student
            {
                Name = $"Student {i+1}",
                Age = random.Next(21, 31),  // Generates a number between 21 and 30
                Grade = random.Next(91, 101),  // Generates a number between 91 and 100
                Exceptional = false,
                HonorRoll = false,
                Passed = false
            });
        }

        return students;
    }
}

// Usage:
var generator = new StudentGenerator();
List<Student> students = generator.GenerateStudents(20);
In this example, names are generated as "Student 1", "Student 2", etc., for simplicity. If you want more complex or real-world names, you may need a different approach or a library that generates fake data, such as Bogus.

Give this 20 objects of Student, of age 21 or above and grade above 90 like a code: new Student { Name = "John", Age = 21, Grade = 95 }



ChatGPT
Here you go, a list of 20 Student objects with an age of 21 or above and a grade above 90. The ages and grades are arbitrarily chosen.

csharp
Copy code
var students = new List<Student> 
{
    new Student { Name = "John", Age = 21, Grade = 95 },
    new Student { Name = "James", Age = 22, Grade = 96 },
    new Student { Name = "Jake", Age = 23, Grade = 97 },
    new Student { Name = "Jack", Age = 24, Grade = 98 },
    new Student { Name = "Jerry", Age = 25, Grade = 99 },
    new Student { Name = "Joe", Age = 26, Grade = 100 },
    new Student { Name = "Jimmy", Age = 27, Grade = 95 },
    new Student { Name = "Jay", Age = 28, Grade = 96 },
    new Student { Name = "Jesse", Age = 29, Grade = 97 },
    new Student { Name = "Jordan", Age = 30, Grade = 98 },
    new Student { Name = "Julius", Age = 21, Grade = 99 },
    new Student { Name = "Josh", Age = 22, Grade = 100 },
    new Student { Name = "Jonas", Age = 23, Grade = 95 },
    new Student { Name = "Jasper", Age = 24, Grade = 96 },
    new Student { Name = "Jared", Age = 25, Grade = 97 },
    new Student { Name = "Jason", Age = 26, Grade = 98 },
    new Student { Name = "Justin", Age = 27, Grade = 99 },
    new Student { Name = "Jeff", Age = 28, Grade = 100 },
    new Student { Name = "Jeremy", Age = 29, Grade = 95 },
    new Student { Name = "Joel", Age = 30, Grade = 96 }
};
The above code creates a List<Student> and initializes it with 20 Student objects with distinct names. Each student has an age of 21 or more and a grade above 90. Note that the names, ages, and grades are hardcoded for simplicity in this example.

Give few collections of 20 objects of Student, that have:
	1) age 21 or above and grade above 90
	2) age less than 21 and grade above 90
	3) grade between 71 and 90 (inclusive)
	4) grade 70 or less
like a code: new Student { Age = 21, Grade = 95 }
