StudentTests:

Positive test case - ConvertStudents_ShouldReturnHonorRoll_ForHighAchiever: This test verifies that the ConvertStudents method in the StudentConverter class correctly identifies high-achieving students and sets the "HonorRoll" property to true for those students. It creates a list of students with increasing ages and grades, and then calls the ConvertStudents method to get the result. The test asserts that the first student in the result list has the "HonorRoll" property set to true.

Positive test case - ConvertStudents_ShouldReturnExceptional_ForYoungHighAchiever: This test validates that the ConvertStudents method correctly identifies young high-achieving students and sets the "Exceptional" property to true for those students. It creates a list of students with increasing ages and grades, starting from a young age. The test calls the ConvertStudents method and asserts that the first student in the result list has the "Exceptional" property set to true.

Positive test case - ConvertStudents_ShouldReturnPassed_ForPassedStudent: This test ensures that the ConvertStudents method correctly identifies students who have passed and sets the "Passed" property to true. It creates a list of students with increasing grades and no specified age. The test calls the ConvertStudents method and asserts that the first student in the result list has the "Passed" property set to true.

Positive test case - ConvertStudents_ShouldReturnFailed_ForFailedStudent: This test verifies that the ConvertStudents method correctly identifies students who have failed and sets the "Passed" property to false. It creates a list of students with decreasing grades. The test calls the ConvertStudents method and asserts that the first student in the result list has the "Passed" property set to false.

Negative test case - ConvertStudents_ShouldReturnEmpty_ForEmptyArray: This test checks the behavior of the ConvertStudents method when an empty list of students is passed. It arranges an empty list of students, calls the ConvertStudents method, and asserts that the result list is empty.

Negative test case - ConvertStudents_ShouldThrowError_ForNullInput: This test verifies that the ConvertStudents method throws an ArgumentNullException when null input is passed. It arranges a null value for the list of students and asserts that calling the ConvertStudents method throws the expected exception.

PlayerTests:

Positive test case - CalculateScore_ShouldReturnScore_WhenNormalPlayer: This test ensures that the CalculateScore method in the PlayerAnalyzer class correctly calculates the score for a normal player. It creates a list with one player, sets their age, experience, and skill levels, and calls the CalculateScore method. The test asserts that the calculated score is equal to the expected value.

Positive test case - CalculateScore_ShouldReturnScore_WhenJuniorPlayer: This test validates that the CalculateScore method correctly calculates the score for a junior player. It creates a list with one player who is younger and less experienced, and has lower skill levels. The test calls the CalculateScore method and asserts that the calculated score is equal to the expected value.

Positive test case - CalculateScore_ShouldReturnScore_WhenSeniorPlayer: This test verifies that the CalculateScore method correctly calculates the score for a senior player. It creates a list with one player who is older, more experienced, and has higher skill levels. The test calls the CalculateScore method and asserts that the calculated score is equal to the expected value.

Positive test case - CalculateScore_ShouldReturnSumScore_WhenMultiplePlayers: This test ensures that the CalculateScore method correctly calculates the total score for multiple players. It creates a list with multiple identical players and calls the CalculateScore method. The test asserts that the calculated score is equal to the expectedvalue, which is the score of a single player multiplied by the number of players.

Negative test case - CalculateScore_ShouldThrowException_WhenSkillsIsNull: This test checks the behavior of the CalculateScore method when a player's skills list is null. It arranges a list with one player whose skills list is set to null and asserts that calling the CalculateScore method throws an ArgumentNullException.

Negative test case - CalculateScore_ShouldReturnZero_WhenPlayersListIsEmpty: This test verifies that the CalculateScore method returns zero when an empty list of players is passed. It arranges an empty list of players, calls the CalculateScore method, and asserts that the calculated score is equal to zero.




To run the tests locally, follow the steps below:

Ensure that you have the necessary development environment set up, including the required dependencies such as .NET Core.

Open the command-line interface (CLI) or an integrated development environment (IDE) that supports running tests.

Navigate to the directory where the test projects are located. In this case, you should navigate to the directory containing the "StudentTests" and "PlayerTests" projects.

Build the test projects by executing the following command:

DOTNET BUILD
Once the build process is complete, run the tests by executing the following command:

DOTNET TEST
This command will execute all the tests within the specified test projects.

After running the tests, you will see the test execution summary and the results in the command-line interface or the test runner provided by your IDE. The test results will indicate whether each test has passed or failed.

Review the test results to ensure that all the tests have passed successfully. If any test fails, the test runner will provide information about the failure, such as the test method name and the reason for the failure.

By following these steps, you should be able to run the tests locally and verify the functionality of the code. Make sure to have the necessary dependencies installed and the test projects properly built before executing the tests.
